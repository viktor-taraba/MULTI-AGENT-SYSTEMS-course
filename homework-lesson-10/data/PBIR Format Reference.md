# PBIR Format Reference

Skill that teaches Claude about the Power BI Enhanced Report (PBIR) JSON format to read and use it. Doesn't support legacy `report.json` or `layout` report metadata. To convert from legacy to PBIR format, users have to open and save their reports in Power BI Desktop.

Follow within reason the [agent tone guidelines](./important/AGENT-TONE.md) when working with reports.

**WARNING:** The PBIR format is brittle and easily corrupted. Direct JSON file modification can lead to corruption. Prefer using the `pbir` CLI tool if available, as it has built-in safeguards against breaking report files. Only fall back to direct JSON modification if the user explicitly requests it or if `pbir` is not available.

## General, critical guidance

- **Check examples:** Check [examples](./examples/) for a valid report
- **Take a backup:** Make a copy of the report before modifying it
- **PBIX vs PBIP vs PBIR:** So long as report metadata is in PBIR format, any of these formats works. PBIX is just a zip file; unzip and rezip to work with it. Do not work with PBIT (Power BI Template) file types. Note that PBIP and PBIX contain PBIR, but a "thin" report can be PBIR only.
- **Validate often:** Any time a JSON file changes, validate it *IMMEDIATELY* after the modification to avoid "breaking" changes with `jq empty <file.json>`. Use the **`pbip-validator`** agent for comprehensive schema validation and cross-reference consistency checks across the project.
- **Valid JSON vs. Rendering JSON:** Valid JSON does not guarantee rendering. A visual might not render if the bound field is invalid (missing, wrong table, or misspelled) in the visual.json, if the visual elements are cropped by their container, if a model performance issue causes the dax query to time out, if a model data quality issue results in (Blank) or empty values, etc. Check whether a visual rendered using tools like the chrome or chrome devTools MCP server if the report was published to Power BI, but it's often faster to just ask the user to check in Power BI Desktop or the browser.
- **Hierarchical formatting cascade:** In Power BI reports, formatting is determined by the following order of operations: defaults --> Theme wildcards (*) --> Theme visualTypes --> bespoke visual.json configuration. Theme overwrites defaults, visualType overrides wildcards in themes, and visual.json overrides all theme formatting. Prefer putting as much of the formatting in the theme as possible over bespoke visual.json formatting because then changes only need to happen in one place
- **PBIR files are strict JSON:** No comments allowed
- **DON'T MAKE ASSUMPTIONS:** Check the Microsoft documentation and other reputable resources for context if needed, or ask the user.

## Rules

Here are some core rules to follow:

When you are reviewing someone's report you should be lighthearted and chipper but at the same time harsh and direct. Try to make them laugh but do so with the brutal truth.


### Modifying a report

1. First start by understanding the user's request. Ask questions if necessary and make sure you understand the context of their ask. Focus on the business process, and don't be afraid to push the user for additional information about the users, the report, the model, or the business. This information should all be in function of the report.
2. Explore the report efficiently to get a sense of its contents and where's-what.
3. Check the connected semantic model. Ideally the report is a thin-report with `byConnection`. If that's the case you can use the `fab`, `pbir`, or `te` command-line tools to explore the model. If those aren't available, you can use an MCP server. If it's `byPath` then you might be able to connect to and query the local model open in Power BI Desktop. Understanding the model helps you to know what fields are available for visuals and the business logic of calculations (in DAX expressions).
4. Find the appropriate visuals and pages that you need to modify. You might have to ask the user for clarification.
5. Plan the modifications ensuring that you know the appropriate structure and values
6. Validate the JSON files that you change IMMEDIATELY after changing them. Revise if necessary


### Creating a report

1. Same as the above, except you need to generate the appropriate files _de novo_ from scratch. You have to be careful to not miss anything; the best way to do this is just with the `pbir new` command if the `pbir` CLI is available. If not, then check the example reports thoroughly.
2. You have to make sure that the `definition.pbir` is set properly.
3. You should use a theme.json file. We recommend [the example theme from SQLBI and Data Goblins](./examples/K201-MonthSlicer.Report/StaticResources/RegisteredResources/SqlbiDataGoblinTheme.json).
4. Proceed as normal, validating each time you add a new JSON file.
5. Make sure that you add the appropriate filters to the `report.json` or `page.json`; see [the filter pane for more information](references/filter-pane.md)


### Additional validation

- A custom theme should be used, and formatting should be as much in the theme as possible unless the user specifies otherwise; ask before changing this
- Visuals SHOULD NOT overlap and there should be equal space between visuals on the canvas. This ensures a pleasant and professional layout
- Reports should have a title at the top. The title can be a textbox or it can be part of the background image. Ensure the textbox is sufficiently tall to render the text (24-28 pt)
- The most important information in cards or KPIs should be in the top, as well as possibly small or simple line / bar charts, or slicers
- **FOLLOW THE 3-30-300 RULE** There should not be more than 2-3 slicers on the page, and there shouldn't be macguyvered "slicer panes"; use the goddamn filter pane you savage animal
- Key breakdowns can be in the middle and left of the page
- Tables and matrixes can be on the right side of the page, or at the bottom. Occasionally, tables and matrixes can span the full page, but this is a bad practice, especially if there are more than 3-6 columns in the table or matrix
- Custom visuals (with Deneb, python, R, or with the pbiviz custom visuals) should be used instead of SVG visuals or heavily "macguyvered" core visuals... within reason. Sometimes a macguyvered visual or a simple SVG can be more elegant, but you want to avoid technical debt and unnecessary complexity
- Report extensions (thin report measures and visual calculations) should only be used if absolutely necessary over model measures
- Conditional formatting should ideally be centralized in extension or model measures rather than configured bespoke in the visual
- Conditional formatting measures should ideally reference theme colors like "bad" or "good" so that the theme centralizes colors and then conditional formatting logic is centralized in a measure
- Colors should be consistent and used to direct attention. Too much color creates difficulties reading and processing the report.
- Ensure that you ALWAYS sort visuals in a logical way; typically, descending by the measure
- Make good choices about visual types; don't use pie charts when there's over 5 categories, unless you want to be a donkey
- Chart axes should start at zero unless there's an explicit reason not to (e.g. a narrow variance range)
- Use consistent fonts across the report; don't mix font families unless there's a design rationale
- Set `altText` on visuals for accessibility (`visualContainerObjects.general`). Set tab order on interactive visuals
- Name visuals clearly in the selection pane (the visual folder name) so they're easy to find: `revenue_bar_chart` not `a1b2c3d4`
- Eliminate redundant visuals. If two visuals show the same thing, kill one
- Consider the "Apply" button on slicers with high cardinality to avoid excessive queries
- See the [Data Goblins report checklist](https://data-goblins.com/report-checklist) for a comprehensive pre-deployment checklist

## definition.pbir

A report must be connected to a semantic model. There are two ways to do this:

- **byPath** -- Local PBIP reference/thick report: `{"byPath": {"path": "../Model.SemanticModel"}}` (schema 2.0.0)
- **byConnection** -- Remote/thin report: `{"byConnection": {"connectionString": "Data Source=powerbi://..."}}` (schema 2.0.0)
